# Rick & Morty - character finder! 👽🛸 

## 🚀 Introduction

In this repository you can find the files generated in the **final evaluation of Module 3 - React** within **[Adalab](https://adalab.es/)'s Web Development Bootcamp - Promo Radia**.

The main objective is to create a **responsive website** with a list of **Rick and Morty characters**, we can **filter** by name, species and character status. The main **requirement** is that **React** is used for **development**.

## 👾 Description 

Welcome to the Rick & Morty - character finder website! If you are interested in getting to know the Rick & Morty universe, you are in the right place.

In this repository we present you a simple, intuitive website adapted to any kind of device (mobile, tablet and PC) so you can take a look at it at any time. Designed and developed with HTML, Sass and React JS, you will find a detailed list of some of the Rick & Morty characters. 

## 📝 Requirements

With a **'React Starter Kit' template** as the starter point, the exercise consists on developing a web-site using the following **elements**:

- **HTML 5**
- **Sass**
- **Flexbox and CSS Grid**
- **Media queries**
- **Javascript**
- **React framework**
- **Interactions with the user**
- **API request**

The following **requirements** have to be respected:

#### List of characters 

The first thing you will find when you access our website will be a list of Rick & Morty characters in **alphabetical order**. We have used the following API to obtain the information about the **first 20 characters of the series**. In the card we will see the following **information about** each of them:

- **Photo**
- **Name**
- **Species**

#### Filtering characters 

Now that we have the list of characters on the screen, we can **search for our favourites** using different types of **filters**:

- **Name**: it doesn't matter if you write it in lower or upper case, the web is programmed to understand that both are equally valid. On the other hand, if you search for a character that does not exist, you will receive an error message to warn you.

</div>

- **Species**: with our filter you can select which characters you want to appear on the screen: whether Human 👨🏻 or Alien 👽.

</div>

- **Status**: select the status of your characters from all the options in the 💀-❤️ list.

</div>

The website also has a **reset button to clear all filters**.

In addition, all the information obtained from the filters will be **recorded in the Local Storage** of your device so that you can go back to your previous search whenever you want without losing the information.

#### Detail of the characters
Whenever you want to **know more about a specific character**, **just click on their image** to access a complete character profile.

<div id="header" align="center">

</div>

One of the particularities of these cards is that the **URL of the character detail is shareable**, that is, if we visit that URL directly in the browser we will be able to see the character detail. In the same way, **if the user navigates to a non-existent URL**, they will receive another **error message** warning them that the address is not correct.

## 🛠️ Tools

The project has been developed with **'React Starter Kit'**, a framework created in node and gulp that has pre-installed and pre-configured functionalities. It also contains an **HTML template engine**, a **Sass preprocessor** and a local server, among other elements.

The following tools have been used when solving the project:

- **HTML** (with partials for an easier lecture and project organization)
- **CSS/Sass**
  - **Variables, mixins and functions**
  - **Flexbox**
  - **CSS Grid**
  - **Box model** (size, padding and margin)
- **JavaScript library: React Native**
  - **Local storage**
  - Accessing and sending data to a server
  - **Event management** in the browser
  - **NodeJS**
  - **API calls**: sending and retrieving data from a server
  - **Tree structure**: organising the project with a tree-like hierarchy
  - **Components**: identifies unique and reusable components
  - **UseState**: state variables for all data manipulated by the user
  - **Props**: information flow from parent to child components
  - **Lifting**: work with events and move information upwards
- **GIT version control**
- **Task Automation: Gulp**
- **JSON**

## 💾 Steps to follow to use this project on your computer:

> **NOTE:** This project has been carried out using **React Starter Kit**.

**First** of all, in order to have the repository on your computer:

1. Click on the top right corner > **Fork**.
2. It will ask you to choose which GitHub user you want to fork it to. **Choose your user**.
3. **Go to github.com/your-user/name-of-project**, **clone it** and do whatever you want, you can rename the repo, change the code, redeploy it to GitHub Pages...
4. **Finally** and for everything to work properly, **you must disable GitHub Pages and re-enable** it so that GitHub generates the new URL correctly.

Once you have **done the fork**:

1. Open it in your code editor.
2. Open a terminal and **install the local dependencies** by executing in the command terminal. Here are the ones I used to start my project:

```bash
npm install 
npm install node-sass
npm install react-router-dom
npm install prop-types
```


The project has to be **started** every time we start programming, to do this we will execute the **command**:

```bash
npm start
```
After running `npm start` we can start editing all the files inside the src/ folder and program comfortably 💫
